          <h3>What's so special about Canberra?</h3>
          <p>
            Canberra is a young city with a rich architectural legacy. With
            major boom periods in the 1920s and again from the 1950s-1980s – the
            architectural aesthetic of the city is eclectic, but deliberately
            cohesive. The mid-late twentieth century period of development in
            Canberra, specifically during the National Capital Development
            Commission’s (NCDC) oversight (1958-1989) has not been widely
            celebrated or recognised by the Canberra community. Major
            developments not only in residential, but civic and community
            buildings saw the frequent involvement of architects now considered
            pioneers of the modernist movement, and the construction of a key
            collection of iconic and unique mid-century buildings in Australia.
            Many of these structures, which make an irreplaceable contribution
            to Canberra, have already been lost and many face risk of being lost
            in the near future. So we at Canberra Modern are here to help by
            engaging Canberra and Australia with their contemporary National
            Capital.

            Nerd’, Tim ‘Rosso’ Ross has always had a passion for architecture
            and design has advocated in this space for many years, often in new,
            engaging and hilarious ways. A long-time supporter of Canberra
            Modern, having performed several of his sell out shows within the
            festival, Tim also passionately supports important issues in
            Australian architecture and design and speaks nationally on
            preserving Australia’s important architectural character and the
            legacy of the many great designers of our nation. In 2018, Tim was
            awarded the National Trust Heritage Award for Advocacy and in 2019,

            Architects, to “recognise him for his advocacy, activism and
            outstanding contribution to the architecture profession”. Canberra

            many years of collaboration and celebration of the rich mid-century
            character of our National Capital.

            20 buildings might seem a lot, but in a city that grew up in the
            mid-century period that showcases work from some of Australia’s most
            renowned architects, it is almost impossible to narrow the list to
            just 20! While many on the list are obvious and iconic, we also
            wanted to include a few buildings that are lesser known or are at
            risk of being lost altogether or visually lost in the midst of
            adjacent developments or inappropriate renovation
